ProcessWirePageLists
====================

JSON files for use with the ProcessWire Page List Migrator module

##Usage

- Get the Page List Migrator module: from https://github.com/adrianbj/ProcessPageListMigrator
- Install the module and run it from the PW Admin Setup page
- Choose Import and follow the prompts

##What is does

When imported, these files will create a page tree (along with any required templates and fields) with one child page for each item (eg country). The child page may contain one or several fields, depending on the list. These lists are perfect for populating ProcessWire Page fieldtypes for use with dropdown select fields.

##More Lists

I would like to see the number of list files here grow with user submissions, so if you create a page tree list that you would like to share, please send me a pull request.
